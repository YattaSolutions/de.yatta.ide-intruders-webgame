# Checkout for web applications

## About this repository

This repository contains a sample frontend and backend of a web application that allows you to test the integration of Yatta Checkout in a secure demo environment.
*  The sample is a mini game you can demo-purchase as a demo user.
*  Use the Checkout to access the game.
*  No real payments or purchases are made in the demo.

You can use this demo to prototype the integration of your own solution, tool or any other digital product.

## Integrate Yatta Checkout to sell your product in Eclipse

Yatta Checkout is designed and built to help you monetize and sell digital products (plugins, frameworks, libraries, SaaS and more) to millions of Eclipse usersâ€”and provide developers access to better and more tooling.

To customize the demo to use it for your own solution, create a demo solution [here](https://yatta.de/portal)... Launch the application and use your new solution to demo-purchase the mini-game.
